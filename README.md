# Intelligent-Wheelchair

This application is designed to apply to the person who can’t use arms or legs well but
without language barriers. The intelligent wheelchair is based on voice control
and can be operated independently through voice commands. Moreover,
the application has a collision- avoidance and warning system. Wheelchair  also can be control by smartphone APP through
Bluetooth. The feature of this application is front-end processing rather than
cloud computing.

## User Manual

### Before Running This Application

In order to open  **UART2** we need to modify following files

- Modify mux.c (/board/emsk/common/emsk_init.c)

```
set_pmod_mux(PM1_UR_UART_0 | PM1_LR_SPI_S	\
				| PM2_I2C_HRI		\
				| PM3_GPIO_AC		\
				| PM4_I2C_GPIO_D	\
				| PM5_UR_SPI_M1 | PM5_LR_SPI_M2	\
				| PM6_UR_GPIO_C | PM6_LR_GPIO_A );
```

- Replace following files:

  [dw_uart_obj.h(board\emsk\drivers)](https://github.com/YuaniLee/Intelligent-Wheelchair/blob/master/dw_uart_obj.h )

  [dw_uart_obj.c(board\emsk\drivers)](https://github.com/YuaniLee/Intelligent-Wheelchair/blob/master/dw_uart_obj.c)

#### Speech recognition config

Connect WEGASUN-M6 to PC by USB to serial port

[M6.jpg](https://github.com/YuaniLee/Intelligent-Wheelchair/blob/master/doc/picture/HMSoft.png)

Open M6SE-IDE with the following settings:

[M6SE-IDE](https://github.com/YuaniLee/Intelligent-Wheelchair/blob/master/doc/picture/M6SE-IDE.JPG)

| Settings                 | Specification                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| @Baud#9600$              | Baud rate                                                    |
| @AsrSET#1,4,06000,6000,$ | data1: recognized distance(20 cm)；data2: match degree; data3: waiting time; data4: recording time |

#### Build and run

| file             | function                             |
| :--------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ble.c            | Bluetooth initialization and control |

| main.c           | Main entry of embARC Application     |
| makefile         | Makefile of embARC Application       |



##### Makefile

- Target options about EMSK and toolchain:

  ```
  BOARD ?= emsk
  TOOLCHAIN ?= gnu
  OLEVEL ?= 02
  BD_VER ?= 22
  CUR_CORE ?= arcem7d
  ```

- DEV config

  ```
  EXT_DEV_LIST += ble/hm1x
  DEV_CSRCDIR +=  $(EMBARC_ROOT)/device/peripheral/adc/ad7991
  DEV_INCDIR +=  $(EMBARC_ROOT)/device/peripheral/adc/ad7991
  ```

- The middleware used in your application:

  ```
   MID_SEL = common
  ```

- Directories of source files and header files:

  ```
  # application source dirs
  APPL_CSRC_DIR = .
  APPL_ASMSRC_DIR = .
  
  # application include dirs
  APPL_INC_DIR = .
  
  # include current project makefile
  COMMON_COMPILE_PREREQUISITES += makefile
  
  ### Options above must be added before include options.mk ###
  # include key embARC build system makefile
  override EMBARC_ROOT := $(strip $(subst \,/,$(EMBARC_ROOT)))
  include $(EMBARC_ROOT)/options/options.mk
  ```

Then`make run`
